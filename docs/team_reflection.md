# Team Activities & Reflection

## What worked well
- Automated tests caught regressions early
- GitHub Actions provided fast feedback on PRs

## Problems encountered & resolutions
- Intermittent failing tests: fixed by stabilizing in-memory data and using deterministic assertions
- Linting differences across dev machines: added an ESLint config and run in CI

## Accountability & decision-making
- Each feature had an owner; PR reviews required 1 approver
- Decisions made by consensus, final call by project lead
